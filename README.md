# How Should I Use this Repository?
First, read the CS3 Hook Document to understand the context, and your mission as a data scientist. Then, read the additional resources to gain more context and technical insight into the project and task at hand. Download the data from the data folder, and ipynb from the scripts folder. The GuidedAnalysis script will provide you with cues on how to complete the first steps of the project, provoke questions, and leave you with creative freedom to answer the question how you see fit. Read through the rubric to make sure you understand what is required as an ouput from the case study. Good luck!
